Visualization of difference between 2016-17 and 2015-16 flu activity levels using [CDC data](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/fluviewinteractive.htm). The visualizations at the link before are great, but with them, it is difficult to compare across multiple years, so I created this plot of the difference.
